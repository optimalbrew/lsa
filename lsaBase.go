const doc1 string = ` Patients after solid organ transplantation (SOT) carry a
	substantially	increased risk to develop malignant lymphomas. This is in part due to the 
 immunosuppression required to maintain the function of the organ graft. 
 Depending on the transplanted organ, up to 15% of pediatric transplant recipients acquire 
 posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), and eventually 20% of those succumb to 
 the disease. Early diagnosis of PTLD is often hampered by the unspecific symptoms and the 
 difficult differential diagnosis, which includes atypical infections as well as graft  
 rejection. Treatment of PTLD is limited by the high vulnerability towards antineoplastic 
 chemotherapy in transplanted children. However, new treatment strategies and especially 
 the introduction of the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab have dramatically 
  improved 
  outcomes of PTLD. This review discusses risk factors for the development of PTLD in 
  children, summarizes current approaches to therapy, and gives an outlook on developing 
  new treatment modalities like targeted therapy with virus-specific T cells. 
  Finally, monitoring strategies are evaluated.  `

const doc2 string = ` PTLD induced by Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is a major cause of 
 morbidity and mortality in solid organ recipients. Despite a growing understanding of the
  pathogenesis of EBV infection and EBV-associated diseases in transplant recipients there 
  remains uncertainty regarding the best clinical management of these patients.
 These guidelines are offered to improve care by establishing consistent evidence-based 
 care.  Where evidence in the pediatric population is lacking, literature from adult 
 patients was reviewed and used where applicable and/or local consensus was used to form
 the recommendations. These guidelines do not address EBV negative PTLD. `

const doc3 string = ` A joint working group established by the Haemato-oncology subgroup
  of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) and the British 
  Transplantation Society (BTS) has reviewed the available literature and made 
  recommendations for the diagnosis and management of post-transplant lymphoproliferative 
  disorder in adult recipients of solid organ transplants. This review details the 
  therapeutic options recommended including reduction in immunosuppression (RIS), 
  transplant organ resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Effective therapy should be 
  instituted before progressive disease results in declining performance status and 
  multiorgan dysfunction. The goal of treatment should be a durable complete remission 
  with retention of transplanted organ function with minimal toxicity. `

const doc4 string = ` Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) represents a 
 spectrum of Epsteinâ€“Barr virus-related (EBV) clinical diseases, from a benign 
 mononucleosis-like illness to a fulminant non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma. In the setting of 
 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, PTLD is an often-fatal complication occurring 
 relatively early after transplant. Risk factors for the development of PTLD are well 
 established, and include HLA-mismatching, T-cell depletion, and the use of 
 antilymphocyte antibodies as conditioning or treatment of graft-versus- host disease. 
 Early recognition of PTLD is particularly important in the SCT setting, because PTLD in 
 these patients tends to be rapidly progressive. Familiarity with the clinical features of 
 PTLD and a heightened level of suspicion are critical for making the diagnosis. 
 Surveillance techniques with EBV antibody titers and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
 may have a role in some high-risk settings. Immune-based therapies such as monoclonal 
 anti-B-cell antibodies, interferon*A, and EBV-specific donor T cells, either as treatment
  for PTLD or as prophylaxis in high-risk patients, represent promising new directions in 
 the treatment of this disease. `
